	Name: Building Assortment
	Description: <<
		Extra buildings, changed buildings, get your fresh new buildings here!

		Contains a variety of stuff, not all of which may show up on a tooltip:

		*Ancient Planetary Cannons fire micro-singularity shells now. They kill fleets.
		*Cloning Center - mid to endgame research unlock, +400% population growth for large maint. cost and research penalty. No new art yet.
		* Cheaper refineries, but they decrease Pressure cap representing your populace having less time to work on raw resources as more of them work in the refinery.
		* Forges slowly generate ore if they are on the same planet as a space elevator (to get the ore where it's needed).  Additionally, forges get LESS expensive again if you demolish them.
		* Habitat Belt, increases population size and buildable area.
		* Trade Stations generate money per friendly planet, and cost a little less, but are limited to one per system.

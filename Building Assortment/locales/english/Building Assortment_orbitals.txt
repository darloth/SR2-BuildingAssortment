ORB_TRADE_STATION_DESC: <<
	A large and bustling station of commerce allows global resource trade between any territories with Commerce Stations.

	In addition, on each commerce station you can purchase a quantity of research, energy, influence or labor in exchange for money every 3 minutes.

	Space elevators generate increased revenue when on planets in systems with a friendly Commerce Station.

	Finally, the Commerce Station generates 45k of budget per friendly planet in system.  This will be split between the owner of the station and the owner of the planet if they are not the same.

	[i]Normally, planets in separated territories cannot export resources to each other. Construct a Commerce Station in both territories in order to allow import and export of resources from planets in your distinct territories.[/i]

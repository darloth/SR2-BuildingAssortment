BLD_REFINERY_DESC: <<
	Adds 1 extra pressure of the native resource's main pressure type but also reduces the planetary pressure cap by 1.

	The pressure is added on this planet only, and is not exported or removed when the native resource is exported.

	[i]Cannot be built on planets without native pressure, or whose only pressure type is money.[/i]
>>
BLD_FORGE_DESC: <<
	Increases labor generation by 25%.

	Will also slowly generate ore (1.5 units / second) if a Space Elevator is present to lift it into orbit.

	The more forges you construct, the larger and more expensive subsequent forges become.

BLD_CLONING_CENTER: Cloning Center
BLD_CLONING_CENTER_DESC: Increases population growth speed by +400%, but has heavy maintenance cost and reduces research income due to clone education burden.  Can be demolished once it is no longer needed.
BLD_ANCIENT_CANNON_DESC: <<
	An ancient, massive, and mysterious planetary cannon, found on this planet and activated by the colonists.

	It fires shells built inside the core of the weapon via unknown processes, but scientists believe each shell contains a micro-singularity ready to explode into a graviton collapse event whenever they strike an enemy vessel.

	The cannon is deactivated if there are enemy fleets sieging the planet, and all the planet's orbital defenses are destroyed.

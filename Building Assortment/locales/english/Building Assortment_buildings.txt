BLD_REFINERY_DESC: <<
	Adds 1 extra pressure of the native resource's main pressure type but also reduces the planetary pressure cap by 1.

	The pressure is added on this planet only, and is not exported or removed when the native resource is exported.

	[i]Cannot be built on planets without native pressure, or whose only pressure type is money.[/i]
>>
BLD_FORGE_DESC: <<
	Increases labor generation by 25%.

	Will also slowly generate ore (1.5 units / second) if a Space Elevator is present to lift it into orbit.

	The more forges you construct, the larger and more expensive subsequent forges become.
>>
BLD_CLONING_CENTER: Cloning Center
BLD_CLONING_CENTER_DESC: Increases population growth speed by +400%, but has heavy maintenance cost and reduces research income due to clone education burden.  Can be demolished once it is no longer needed.
BLD_ANCIENT_CANNON_DESC: <<
	An ancient, massive, and mysterious planetary cannon, found on this planet and activated by the colonists.

	It fires shells built inside the core of the weapon via unknown processes, but scientists believe each shell contains a micro-singularity ready to explode into a graviton collapse event whenever they strike an enemy vessel.

	The cannon is deactivated if there are enemy fleets sieging the planet, and all the planet's orbital defenses are destroyed.
>>
BLD_PLANET_CANNON_DESC: <<
	An enormous railgun on the planet's surface propels large projectiles towards enemy fleets in the system, inflicting devastating damage.

	The cannon deals 600 Damage every 5 seconds at 1500 range using default self-manufactured projectiles, but either effective damage or range can be significantly upgraded with specialized munitions.

	[i]If there are enemy fleets in orbit and you do not have any remaining support ships to protect the satellite guidance system, the artillery cannon is disabled.[/i]

BLD_HIEXAMMOPLANT: High-Explosive Gel Ammo Plant
BLD_HIEXAMMOPLANT_DESC: <<
	Produces railgun shells packed with magnetically stable high explosive gel.

	These shells use a second stage detonation to massively increase both the area and effective damage compared to unmodified railgun shells, but as a result of spreading this damage over a large area they are less effective against heavy armor or single vessels.
>>
BLD_ROCKETAMMOPLANT: Rocket-Assisted Ammo Pre-Assembler
BLD_ROCKETAMMOPLANT_DESC: <<
	Produces railgun shells with an additional rocket boost stage to accelerate them after leaving the atmosphere, though they are effectively unguided after the boost.

	These shells are very effective against large single vessels.  Although they almost entirely lack an area radius effect as so much of the explosive has to be removed to leave space for the booster, their enhanced kinetic velocity allows for greater force to be delivered to their targets, and a lucky shot can often gut larger ships in a single hit.
